# Basic building blocks of web application development

- Programming Languages
  - A Programming language is a set of instructions with some logic that is used to create programs that gives desired out
  - It acts as an interface of communication between user and computer
  - Some of the popular programming languages are:
    - JavaScript
    - Python
    - Java
    - C#
    - Golang
  - Types of programming Language
    - Procedural Programming Language (C, Pascal)
    - Functional Programming Language (Skala, Haskell)
    - Scripting Programming Language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
    - Logic Programming Language (Prolog, ASP)
    - Object-Oriented Programming Language (C++, Java)
  - Javascript is most widely used language for web development
  - It can be used for both front-end as well as back-end, hence being cost efficient to the company
- IP Address

  - IP Address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or local network
  - It helps in connecting your computer to other devices on your network and all over the world
  - IP Address example: 506.457.14.512
  - Two types of IP Address: All private and public IP addresses can be either static or dynamic.

    - Static IP Address: IP addresses that you configure manually and fix them to the network of your device are called static IP addresses. Static IP addresses cannot change automatically.

    - Dynamic IP Address: The dynamic IP address configures automatically and assign an IP to your network when you set up the router with internet.

  - Two types primary types of IP address format used today: - IPv4(Mostly used in networking) - IPv6(Latest iteration)

  - IPv4

    - | Class   | Range   | Uses                             |
      | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
      | Class A | 0-127   | 127 is reserved for local system |
      | Class A | 128-191 | Internet                         |
      | Class A | 192-223 | 192, 168 used for local network  |
      | Class A | 224-239 | Not used, Reserved               |
      | Class A | 242-255 | Not Used                         |

- Ports

  - A port is a logical connection place and specifically, using the Internet's protocol, TCP/IP
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) have ports with preassigned numbers.
  - Ports are entry points for communication to the application
  - Port has number which ranges from 0 - 65535
  - 0-1023 are reserved and used by system
  - Web ports 80 and 443 are used for http and https respectively

- Domain

  - A domain is a group of resources assigned to a specific group of individuals.
  - Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes
  - DNS provides domain name to the host
  - It is used to divide global areas or departments of a corporation.

- Browsers
  - A browser is an application that is used to access the internet
  - Some of the most popular browser are:
    - Google Chrome
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Brave Browser
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Safari
- Postman

  - Postman is an API development tool which helps build, test and modify APIs.
  - It is a powerful tool used to test web services

- Code Editor

  - Code editor is an application in which we write and edit code and build projects
  - VSCode (Most used and reliable for javascript)
  - Atom
  - Sublime Text

- HTTP and HTTPS

  - HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol
  - HTTPS stands for HTTP Secure
  - HTTP connection allows data to be sniffed
  - HTTPS encrypts data that prevents data sniffing

- Web Server

  - A web server is used to store raw data that can be requested and accessed by the user throught the website and displays it on it
    - Nginx
    - Apache web server
    - Glassfish server(Used in J2EE can be used as web server)
    - xampp

- HTTP verbs

  - GET (Used to request data from server to client)
  - POST (Used to send data to a server from client)
  - PUT (Used to update data to a server)
  - HEAD (Same as get but doesn't return user lists)
  - DELETE (Used to delete data)
  - OPTIONS (It is used as queries)

- HTTP Headers

  - HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response
  - Request header holds the information about the resource to be fetched
  - Response header holds the information about the reponse

- HTTP Status codes

  - 100-199 : Informational
  - 200-299 : Success
  - 200 : OK- Request successful
  - 300-399 : Migration
  - 400-499 : Client error
  - 400 : Bad Request
  - 401 : Unauthorized
  - 403 : Forbidden
  - 404 : Not found
  - 500 : Server Error

- Software Licences

  - It is a legal instrument for distribution and use of a software
  - MIT License
  - BSD licenses
  - GNU General Public License
  - Apache License

- SSL Certificates

  - It is a security protocol that provides primary authentication and integrity to Internet communication

- Database
  - The collection of multiple data entries together creates a database
  - DBMS softwares are used to interact with databases and perform operation such as creating, editing, deleting and inserting data
  - There are two types of databases:
    - Relational database : Entries are stored in tabular format and it slow to fetch result when data increases
      - MySQL
      - PostgreSQL
    - Non-Relational database : Entries are stored in key-value pair
      - MongoDB
      - Redis
- Cloud Providers

  - Cloud helps us to access anything remotely over the internet
  - Following are some of the major cloud providers:
    - Amazon Web Services(AWS)
    - Google Cloud Platform
    - Microsoft Azure
    - DigitalOcean
    - Vultr
    - Linode LLC
